/**
 * Base class for Omnipedia date range Views filter plug-ins.
 *
 * As of Drupal core 8.9/9.2, there isn't yet a Views filter bundled with core,
 * despite @link https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2924061 ongoing
 * work in a core issue since 8.5. @endlink Creating a filter plug-in with the
 * full range of options and settings to handle all or most use cases for date
 * range fields is out of scope of Omnipedia, so while this may be revisited at
 * a later date, the quick and simple solution is to treat the start and end
 * dates as their own fields, and apply different filter plug-ins to each
 * independently.
 *
 * Note that the plug-ins do not currently use the 'First date' and 'Last date'
 * labels like the rest of the Omnipedia date code due to the additional
 * complexity of dealing with that in a Views filter. Keeping the exposed
 * filters as not required allows the use of the '- Any -' option, which is
 * identical in functionality. In the future, that label may be altered if
 * feasible, but is currently left as-is.
 *
 * @see https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2924061
 *   Ongoing issue to add a date range Views filter plug-in to Drupal core.
 *
 * @see https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/226884/how-to-filter-a-view-by-date-range-start-end
 *   Drupal Answers thread with various general use solutions.
 *
 * @see https://www.drupal.org/project/views_daterange_filters
 *   General purpose Views date range filter module. Does not have a stable
 *   release at the time of writing with security coverage.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/barsan-md/interval-filter
 *   General purpose Views filter that can filter based on two fields, one as a
 *   minimum value and another as a maximum value. Does not appear to have a
 *   stable release with security coverage.
 *
 * @see \Drupal\omnipedia_attached_data\Entity\OmnipediaAttachedDataViewsData::getViewsData()
 *   Example of how to assign filter plug-ins to date range start and end
 *   fields.
